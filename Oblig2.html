      In August 2012 Melinda Gates received an honorary doctorate at Karolinska
      Institutet in recognition of her support for scientific work on global
      health issues at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The award recognizes
      the couple's active and long-term condition to improving human health
      where the need is greatest, acheived through their work with partners
      worldwide.

        >Together, we are changing millions of lives and I find it inspiring and
        energizing to witness firsthand the Karolinska Institutet's ability,
        knowledge, and resources to help people around the world live a better
        life</q
      >, said Melinda Gates, co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.
      Guided by the belief that every life has equal value, Bill and Melinda
      Gates created the foundation to help all people lead healthy, productives
      lives.

      In developing countries, the foundation focuses on improving people's
      health and giving them the chance to lift themselves out of hunger and
      extreme poverty. In the United States, it seeks to ensure that all people
      - especially those with the fewest resources - have access to the
      oppurtunity they need to succeed in school and life.

      A new lecture hall complex - scheduled for completion in the summer of
      2013 - will enable Karolinska Institutet to arrange major public events,
      such as the Nobel lectures, which attract audiences from around the world.
      Wingårdh Architects have designed the building, the form and geometry of
      which constrasts with the tradtional low-rise brick buildings on the Solna
      Campus. The building will house a 1,000-seat auditorium, office space for
      approximately 90 staff, 100 conference seats and restaurants. The
      auditorium, with the exception of the office and service facilities, has
      been fully financed by a private donation from the Erling-Persson
      Foundation.

      Four Swedish universities is behind the Science for Life Laboratory, a
      huge new investments in life science research.
    </p>

    <p class="tekst">
      In 2013, the SciLifeLab is becoming a national research institute for
      major research in molecular biosciences and bioinformatics. SciLifeLab
      will grow to employ about 1000 scientists and have a turnover of about 1
      billion SEK within a few years. In addition to funding from the
      government, the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation will invest 220
      million SEK on technology laboratories in SciLifeLab and Astra Zeneca
      intends to invest 5-10 million USD anually for five years.
    </p>

    <p class="tekst">
      SciLifeLab is a joint venture between four universities; Karolinska
      Institutet, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm University and
      Uppsala University. The medical research focuses on investigating the
      molecular basis of complex human diseases, and seeks to find biomarkers
      that can help diagnose diseases and monitor their progress. SciLifeLab has
      facilities both in Stockholm and in Uppsala.

      Karolinska Institutet and AstraZeneca strengthen their collaboration
    </h3>

    <p class="sidebar2">
      The development of new drugs and the swifter introduction of new clinical
      methods and treatments - this is the aim of the new translational research
      centre set up by Karolinska Institutet and AstraZeneca 2012. Translational
      research is based on questions raised within healthcare. The research is
      done in laboratories and the results are then fed back as new methods of
      treatment and diagnosis. The new centre is to discover biomarkers -
      biological traces in the blod or tissue that can signal whether a person
      is ill, or risks becoming so later in life. Identifying and understanding
      enw biomarkers will help scientists prevent disease and produce more
      effective treatments and new drugs. Chronic diseases such as dementia,
      cancer, rheumatism, cardiovascular disease, metabolic disorders and mental
      ill-health, which currently account for 80 percent of the country's health
      costs, will be the centre's main focus. The centre will initially be
      running for five years. During 2012 Karolinska Institutet and AstraZeneca
      also started a three year collaborative research agreement that will apply
      state of the art molecular imaging technologies to generate novel
      diagnostic imaging tools.
